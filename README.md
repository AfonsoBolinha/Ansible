# Ansible Challenges Repository

Welcome to my repository of Ansible challenges! Here, I have documented and resolved various challenges related to network automation and configuration management. These challenges are grouped into three categories: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.

---

## ðŸŸ¢ Beginner Challenges

### 1. Basic Connectivity Check
- **Objective:** Create a playbook that:
  - Pings all devices in your inventory.
  - Uses the `ansible.builtin.ping` module.

### 2. Gather and Save Facts
- **Objective:** Create a playbook that:
  - Gathers facts from all devices.
  - Writes a summary (`hostname`, `interfaces`, `OS`, `uptime`) to a file.

### 3. Configure Hostnames
- **Objective:** Push a hostname config to all your routers/switches.
  - Make the hostname dynamic using the inventory name.

## ðŸŸ¡ Intermediate Challenges

### 4. VLAN Automation
- **Objective:** On your switches:
  - Create VLANs 10, 20, and 30.
  - Assign names to each VLAN.
  - Ensure the playbook is idempotent.

### 5. Backup Device Configurations
- **Objective:** Create a playbook to SSH into devices and save the running config to a local file on your Ansible control node.

### 6. Deploy NTP Settings
- **Objective:** Push NTP server settings to all routers and switches.
  - Verify with a command that NTP is working.

## ðŸ”´ Advanced Challenges

### 7. Dynamic Inventory from GNS3
- **Objective:** Instead of a static hosts file, generate inventory dynamically based on GNS3 topology using a script or API.

### 8. Rolling Update with Confirmation
- **Objective:** Create a playbook that updates device configs in batches.
  - After each batch, pause and wait for user confirmation to proceed.

### 9. Compliance Checker
- **Objective:** Write a playbook that checks if all routers have:
  - A specific hostname format.
  - SSH enabled.
  - Specific SNMP community strings.
  - Report non-compliant devices.

### 10. Error Handling with Rescue/Always
- **Objective:** Simulate failure (e.g., bad config on a device).
  - Use `block`, `rescue`, and `always` to handle the error gracefully and restore the last known good config.

Feel free to explore the individual challenge folders to see how each of these problems was solved. Each challenge comes with a detailed explanation and the Ansible playbook used to solve it.

Happy automating! ðŸš€
